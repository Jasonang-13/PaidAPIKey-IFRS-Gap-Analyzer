# Finding Git/Version Control in Replit

## Visual Guide: Where to Look

### Option 1: Left Sidebar Icons
Look for these icons in your left sidebar:
```
📁 Files
🔍 Search  
🏃 Run
🔧 Tools
📦 Packages
🌐 Git/Version Control  ← This one!
⚙️ Settings
```

The Git icon might look like:
- A branching tree symbol
- Two circles connected by lines
- The word "Git" or "Version Control"

### Option 2: Top Menu Bar
Check the top menu for:
- "Version Control" tab
- "Git" option
- "Source Control" panel

### Option 3: Three-Dot Menu
Look for:
- Three dots (...) menu → "Version Control"
- Hamburger menu (≡) → "Git" or "Version Control"

## If You Still Don't See It

### Use Shell Method Instead
1. Click the "Shell" tab at the bottom of your screen
2. It looks like a terminal/command prompt icon
3. A black terminal window will open at the bottom

### Alternative: Tools Menu
- Look for "Tools" in the sidebar
- Click it and look for "Git" or "Version Control" options

Once you find either the Version Control panel OR the Shell, let me know and I'll guide you through the connection process!
